- **Restart SystemUI is mandatory for changing Control Center color** after changing the theme or wallpaper.
- **No restart needed for changing Settings, Dialer, Contacts, and Messaging color** after changing theme or wallpaper. **Simply "Force Stop" the app**.
- To switch between default and themed icons, reflash the module and select a version.
- The **Settings app also links to other apps** such as Security, cleaner, permissions, themes, notifications, launcher, etc. These apps are not monet themed yet. Please do not report such apps.
- **We won't support custom icons & custom Control Center from custom MIUI ROMs / modules**.
- **We won't support Port ROMs** since there are some reports that Port ROMs can't use our modules.
